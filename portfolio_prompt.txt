Act as a senior front-end engineer and UI/UX designer with deep experience in Linux desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, i3) and modern web animations.
I am building a portfolio website styled like a minimal Linux operating system desktop.

Overall Theme
 * The homepage should visually feel like a Linux OS login/desktop screen
 * Dark, monochrome, futuristic aesthetic
 * Minimal UI, glassmorphism where appropriate
 * No clutter, no gradients unless subtle
 * Smooth 60fps animations only

Background
 * I already have a static abstract black-and-white background image
 * The background must remain fixed and untouched
 * No parallax on background

Main Text (Critical Feature)
 * Centered headline text: “Welcome to techieman.os”
 * Font should resemble a terminal / sci-fi / OS-style font
 * Text color: white or slightly off-white

Hover Interaction (VERY IMPORTANT)
 * When the cursor hovers over the text, a small black circular dot (like a magnet or cursor gravity point) must appear
 * This dot must follow the cursor smoothly
 * The dot must be strictly clipped to the text shape
 * The dot must NOT appear outside the text area
 * The effect should feel like the cursor is “distorting” or “activating” the text
 * No background interaction — ONLY the text reacts
 * Use masking, clipping paths, or shader-like logic if needed

Dock / Icons Section
 * Bottom-center dock similar to Linux / macOS dock
 * Icons already exist (home, terminal, files, projects, etc.)
 * Dock should have slight blur + translucent background

Icon Hover Animation
 * On hover, icons should translate slightly upward on the Y-axis
 * Add subtle easing (not springy, not bouncy)
 * Optional: tiny scale-up (max 1.05)
 * Icons must return smoothly to original position

Linux Flavor Details (Fill Gaps Creatively)
 * Add small Linux-inspired micro-details such as:
   * Subtle boot-like fade-in animation on page load
   * Minimal status-bar feel (without clutter)
   * Desktop-environment vibe (GNOME/KDE inspiration)
 * Do NOT turn this into a fake OS — it’s a portfolio, not a simulator

Technical Expectations
 * Clean, modular HTML structure
 * CSS animations preferred; JS only when required
 * No external heavy animation libraries unless absolutely necessary
 * Prioritize performance and readability

Output Expectation
 * Generate the full homepage implementation
 * Focus heavily on hover interactions and polish
 * Write clean, commented, production-quality code
 * Assume all images and icons are already available locally
